      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am Ben Staunton, a First-Class Mathematics graduate from the University of Nottingham and now studying for an MSc in Statistics at the University of Warwick.
        I tutor GCSE Mathematics, GCSE Statistics, A-Level Mathematics, A-Level Statistics, and Further Mathematics at both GCSE and A-Level.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was raised in a family devoted to education. My father has worked as an 11+ tutor for more than 25 years, and my mother runs a Montessori nursery school for early years children. Growing up in this environment inspired me to value education highly and encouraged me to begin tutoring alongside my own studies. Over the past few years, I have tutored a range of students at both GCSE and A-Level, both individually and in small groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond academics, I am a committed calisthenics athlete, train in triathlon, and was a semi-professional show jumper during my secondary school years. I also enjoy travelling, mountaineering, and cooking. During my undergraduate degree, I took part in competitive mathematics, where I placed first and third in university mathematics competitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my time at university, I also ran the University of Nottingham Investment Fund, which managed over £40,000. In this role, I frequently delivered training sessions to more than 150 students, further developing my ability to explain complex ideas clearly and engage large groups. In addition to this, I have gained professional experience through internships in financial institutions, including one of the largest hedge funds in the world. These opportunities have given me practical insight into how mathematics and statistics are used in industry, further strengthening the way I teach these subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
        My tutoring style is clear, structured, and supportive while also results-focused. A typical lesson often begins with me explaining the theory behind a new concept in a simple and accessible way. I then work through a fully explained example, showing how the theory applies in practice. After this, I guide students as they attempt questions on their own, offering feedback and support where needed. The structure can vary depending on the student’s familiarity with the topic, but this approach ensures both understanding and application are developed together.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hold an Enhanced DBS certificate, available on request, and references from previous students can also be provided. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you would like further information or to arrange an initial consultation.
