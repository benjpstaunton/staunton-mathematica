      <h3 id="bio-title">Bio</h3>
      <p>I am Ben Staunton, a First-Class Mathematics graduate from the University of Nottingham and now studying for an MSc in Statistics at the University of Warwick. I tutor GCSE Mathematics, GCSE Statistics, A-Level Mathematics, A-Level Statistics, and Further Mathematics at both GCSE and A-Level.</p>
      <p>I was raised in a family devoted to education. My father has worked as an 11+ tutor for more than 25 years, and my mother runs a Montessori nursery school. Growing up in this environment inspired me to value education highly and encouraged me to begin tutoring alongside my own studies.</p>
      <p>Over the past few years, I have tutored a range of students at both GCSE and A-Level, individually and in small groups. Beyond academics, I train in calisthenics and triathlon, and I was a semi-professional show jumper during secondary school. I also enjoy travelling, mountaineering, and cooking.</p>
      <p>During my undergraduate degree, I placed first and third in university mathematics competitions. I also ran the University of Nottingham Investment Fund, which managed over £40,000, frequently delivering training sessions to more than 150 students.</p>
      <p>I have gained professional experience through internships in financial institutions, including one of the largest hedge funds in the world, giving me practical insight into how mathematics and statistics are used in industry.</p>

      <h3 id="approach-title">Approach</h3>
      <p>My tutoring style is clear, structured, and supportive while also results-focused. A typical lesson begins with an accessible explanation of the theory behind a new concept. I then work through a fully explained example showing how the theory applies in practice. After this, students attempt questions independently while I provide feedback and support. The exact structure varies by student, but this combination builds both understanding and application.</p>
      <p>I hold an Enhanced DBS certificate (available on request), and references can be provided. Please get in touch to arrange a free initial consultation.</p>
